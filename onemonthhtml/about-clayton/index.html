			<h1>About Clayton</h1>
			<h2>Automating Stuff | Creative Programming</h2>

			I'm currently a QC Engineer at Simulia. I studied Mechanical
			Engineering with a specialization in Computer Aided Design.

			My most favorite programming language is Python, after all
			thats what I used to convert my thoughts to action, which 
			the computer performed.
